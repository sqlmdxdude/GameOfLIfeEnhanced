// Game of life enhanced by Robert Attaway
//
// Purpose: Conway's Game of life was interesting but not robust. So I decided I wanted
//          to create a more interesting version that would allow the game to use some
//          principles of evolution to allow for more dynamic results
//
//          Instead of just implementing the basic rules the follwing extensions will apply
//          1. Cells will have additional properties
//          2. A random function will determine if a cell can evolve
//          3. There will be various mutations that the cell can inherit
